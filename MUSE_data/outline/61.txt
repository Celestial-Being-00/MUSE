His senses attuned to the whispers of the ages, he discerns a murmur of conspiracy. A clandestine cult, its figures shrouded in the fabric of the night, converges on a relic of forgotten lore, its power a cipher of life's end and the empire's fate. Marcus, the guardian of Rome's secret legacy, is drawn into the intrigue. - **Event 2**: Disguised as a scholar named Lucius Quadratus, Marcus Antonius infiltrates the cult's clandestine meetings held in the Atrium of Vibia, his mind a forge of ancient wisdom. He deciphers that the artifact, known as the 'Scepter of Eternity,' is the key to his own immortality, a bond forged in the crucible of the empire's salvation. The cult's leader, identified as Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus, a figure cloaked in ambition and mystery, speaks of a revelation that will reshape the empire's destiny, unaware that Marcus is the fulcrum of their prophecy. - **Event 3**: With the cult's secrets laid bare, Marcus, the strategos of Rome's defenses, deciphers the arcane symbols etched within the ancient texts that reveal the artifact's hidden repository.

Their investigation leads them to Decimus Caecilius, a senator with野心 masked by his distinguished gens Caecilia lineage. Decimus aims to exploit the artifact's power to depose the sitting leadership, unaware of the chaos this would unleash upon Rome. - **Event 7**: Marcus and Aurelia present themselves to Tiberius Claudius Nero, Rome's High Pontiff and custodian of ancient enigmas, at the Campus Martius at the fourth hour post-meridiem. The High Pontiff reveals the artifact's true nature as the source of Marcus's immortality, which can only be nullified through a self-sacrificial act within the Sacellum of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. As Marcus grapples with the artifact's potent influence, he is internally torn between his unwavering allegiance to Rome and his desire to end his eternal solitude. - **Event 8**: The manipulations within the Senate reach a crescendo as Marcus and Aurelia gather the necessary components for the artifact's destruction ritual. They retrieve the Chalice of Aeneas from the Temple of Venus, situated atop the Aventine Hill, and the Robe of Evander from Evander's sanctuary in the Forum Boarium. Meanwhile, the Temple of Mars Ultor, situated near the Forum of Julius Caesar, becomes a focal point of tension and anticipation, as the Ides of March approaches, with the ritual's outcome pending. - **Event 9**: Tiberius Claudius Nero, Rome's High Pontiff, supervises the precise execution of the ritual at the Temple of Apollo Palatinus, situated atop the Palatine Hill.

The tale of Marcus Antonius's selfless act, relinquishing his immortality for Rome's salvation, becomes a beacon of inspiration and bravery across the empire. In recognition of his service, the Columna Antonii, a majestic monument, is unveiled in his honor atop the Capitoline Hill, a site of great significance to Roman society. - **Event 12**: In the tranquil Elysian Fields, Marcus Antonius is reunited with Livia Drusilla, finding solace and companionship amidst the verdant landscape reserved for the heroic and virtuous.
